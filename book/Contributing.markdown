How can I clone the Sinatra repository?
---------------------------------------

First of all, you'll need the [Git][git] version control system. [Git][git] is
available for all major platforms:
* [Windows][git_win]
* [Mac OS X][git_osx]
* Linux and BSD users can usually acquire [Git][git] through their Package
  Management System, e.g. `apt-get install git-core` on Debian systems.

After that, cloning the Sinatra repository is as easy as typing the following
into your command line:

    git clone git://github.com/bmizerany/sinatra.git

[git]: http://git.or.cz
[git_win]: http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/
[git_osx]: http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/
