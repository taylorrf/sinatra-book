Helpers
=======

The basics
----------

It is ill-advised to create helpers on the root level of your application.  They muddy the global namespace, and don't
have easy access to the request, response, session or cookie variables.

Instead, use the handy helpers method to install methods on `Sinatra::EventContext` for use inside events and templates.

Example:

    helpers do
      def bar(name)
        "#{name}bar"
      end
    end
    
    get '/:name' do
      bar(params[:name])
    end

Implemention of rails style partials
------------------------------------

Using partials in your views is a great way to keep them clean.  Since Sinatra takes the hands off approach to framework
design, you'll have to implement a partial handler yourself.  

Here is a really basic version:

    # Usage: partial :foo
    helpers do
      def partial(page, options={})
        haml page, options.merge!(:layout => false)
      end
    end

A more advanced version that would handle passing local options, and looping over a hash would look like:

    # Render the page once:
    # Usage: partial :foo
    # 
    # foo will be rendered once for each element in the array, passing in a local variable named "foo"
    # Usage: partial :foo, :collection => @my_foos    

    helpers do
      def partial(template, *args)
        options = args.extract_options!
        options.merge!(:layout => false)
        if collection = options.delete(:collection) then
          collection.inject([]) do |buffer, member|
            buffer << haml(template, options.merge(
                                      :layout => false, 
                                      :locals => {template.to_sym => member}
                                    )
                         )
          end.join("\n")
        else
          haml(template, options)
        end
      end
    end
