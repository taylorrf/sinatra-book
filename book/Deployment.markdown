Deployment
==========

Lighttpd Proxied to Thin        {#deployment_lighttpd}
------------------------

This will cover how to deploy Sinatra to a load balanced reverse
proxy setup using Lighttpd and Thin.

1. Install Lighttpd and Thin

       # Figure out lighttpd yourself, it should be handled by your 
       # linux distro's package manager
        
       # For thin:
       gem install thin

2. Create your rackup file -- the `require 'app'` line should require the actual 
   Sinatra app you have written.


       require 'rubygems'
       require 'sinatra'
       
       set :env,       :production
       set :port,      4567
       disable :run, :reload
       
       require 'app'
       
       run Sinatra.application

3. Setup a config.yml - change the /path/to/my/app path to reflect reality.

       ---
         environment: production
         chdir: /path/to/my/app
         address: 127.0.0.1
         user: root
         group: root
         port: 4567
         pid: /path/to/my/app/thin.pid
         rackup: /path/to/my/app/config.ru
         log: /path/to/my/app/thin.log
         max_conns: 1024
         timeout: 30
         max_persistent_conns: 512
         daemonize: true

4. Setup lighttpd.conf - change mydomain to reflect reality. Also make 
   sure the first port here matches up with the port setting in config.yml.

       $HTTP["host"] =~ "(www\.)?mydomain\.com"  {
               proxy.balance = "fair"
               proxy.server =  ("/" =>
                                       (
                                               ( "host" => "127.0.0.1", "port" => 4567 ),
                                               ( "host" => "127.0.0.1", "port" => 4568 )
                                       )
                               )
       }

5. Start thin and your application. I have a rake script so I can just 
   call "rake start" rather than typing this in. 

       thin -s 2 -C config.yml -R config.ru start

You're done! Go to mydomain.com/ and see the result! Everything should be setup
now, check it out at the domain you setup in your lighttpd.conf file.

*Variation* - nginx via proxy - The same approach to proxying can be applied to
the nginx web server

    upstream www_mydomain_com {
      server 127.0.0.1:5000;
      server 127.0.0.1:5001;
    }
    
    server {
      listen    www.mydomain.com:80
      server_name  www.mydomain.com live;
      access_log /path/to/logfile.log
      
      location / {
        proxy_pass http://www_mydomain_com;
      }
      
    }

*Variation* - More Thin instances - To add more thin instances, change the 
`-s 2` parameter on the thin start command to be how ever many servers you want. 
Then be sure lighttpd proxies to all of them by adding more lines to the proxy 
statements. Then restart lighttpd and everything should come up as expected.


Passenger (mod rails)           {#deployment_passenger}
------------------------
Hate deployment via FastCGI? You're not alone.  But guess what, Passenger supports Rack;
and this book tells you how to get it all going.

You can find additional documentation at the Passenger Github repository.


1. Setting up the account in the Dreamhost interface

       Domains -> Manage Domains -> Edit (web hosting column)
       Enable 'Ruby on Rails Passenger (mod_rails)'
       Add the public directory to the web directory box. So if you were using 'rails.com', it would change to 'rails.com/public'
       Save your changes

2. Creating the directory structure

       domain.com/
       domain.com/tmp
       domain.com/public
       # a vendored version of sinatra - not necessary if you use the gem
       domain.com/sinatra

3. Creating the "Rackup file" (rack configuration file) `config.ru` -- the `require 'app'`
   line should require the actual Sinatra app you have written.

       # This file goes in domain.com/config.ru
       require 'rubygems'
       require 'sinatra'
        
       set :env,  :production
       disable :run
       
       require 'app'
       
       run Sinatra.application


4. A very simple Sinatra application

       # this is test.rb referred to above
       get '/' do
         "Worked on dreamhost"
       end
        
       get '/foo/:bar' do
         "You asked for foo/#{params[:bar]}"
       end

And that's all there is to it! Once it's all setup, point your browser at your 
domain, and you should see a 'Worked on Dreamhost' page. To restart the 
application after making changes, you need to run `touch tmp/restart.txt`.

Please note that currently passenger 2.0.3 has a bug where it can cause Sinatra to not find
the view directory. In that case, add `:views => '/path/to/views/'` to the Sinatra options
in your Rackup file.

Additional note: some documentation sources will have a different format for passing options to Sinatra in the Rackup file, e.g.:
    
    Sinatra::Application.default_options.merge!(
      :run => false,
      :env => :production,
      :raise_errors => true
    )
    
This is perfectly valid, however calling `set`, `disable` and `enable` is preferred.

FastCGI                         {#deployment_fastcgi}
-------

The standard method for deployment is to use Thin or Mongrel, and have a 
reverse proxy (lighttpd, nginx, or even Apache) point to your bundle of servers.

But that isn't always possible.  Cheaper shared hosting (like Dreamhost) won't
let you run Thin or Mongrel, or setup reverse proxies (at least on the default
shared plan).

Luckily, Rack supports various connectors, including CGI and FastCGI.  Unluckily
for us, FastCGI doesn't quite work with the current Sinatra release.

To get a simple 'hello world' Sinatra application up and running on Dreamhost
involves pulling down the current Sinatra code, and hacking at it a bit.  Don't
worry though, it only requires commenting out a few lines, and tweaking
another.

Steps to deploy via FastCGI:

* .htaccess
* dispatch.fcgi
* Tweaked sinatra.rb


1. .htaccess
       RewriteEngine on
        
       AddHandler fastcgi-script .fcgi
       Options +FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI
        
       RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]

2. dispatch.fcgi
   
       #!/usr/bin/ruby
        
       require 'rubygems'
       require 'sinatra/lib/sinatra'
        
       fastcgi_log = File.open("fastcgi.log", "a")
       STDOUT.reopen fastcgi_log
       STDERR.reopen fastcgi_log
       STDOUT.sync = true
        
       set :logging, false
       set :server, "FastCGI"
        
       module Rack
         class Request
           def path_info
             @env["REDIRECT_URL"].to_s
           end
           def path_info=(s)
             @env["REDIRECT_URL"] = s.to_s
           end
         end
       end
        
       load 'app.rb'

3. sinatra.rb - Replace this function with the new version here (commenting out the `puts` lines)

       def run
         begin
           #puts "== Sinatra has taken the stage on port #{port} for #{env} with backup by #{server.name}"
           require 'pp'
           server.run(application) do |server|
             trap(:INT) do
               server.stop
               #puts "\n== Sinatra has ended his set (crowd applauds)"
             end
           end
         rescue Errno::EADDRINUSE => e
           #puts "== Someone is already performing on port #{port}!"
         end
       end

Heroku
------

[Heroku] has added basic support for Sinatra applications. This is possibly the easiest deployment option as once correctly configured,  
deploying to Heroku becomes simply a matter of pushing to git  

Steps to deploy to Heroku:

* make a config/rackup.ru
* push to git

1. An example rackup file
        
       set :app_file, File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../my_sinatra_app.rb')
       set :public,   File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../public')
       set :views,    File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../views')
       set :env,      :production
       disable :run, :reload
       
       require File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/../my_sinatra_app"
       
       run Sinatra.application

2. push to git
        
       $ git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:my-sinatra-app.git
       $ git push heroku master
